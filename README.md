# non prime

Write a function that returns a list of all non-prime numbers between two positive integers
supplied as arguments. Use this is in a program that asks the user to supply two positive
integers, checks that the input is valid, then calls the function and outputs the numbers in
the returned list, with 10 numbers per output line.

If the user enters negative numbers or supplies non-numeric input the program should
output an appropriate error message; the two numbers should be accepted in either order.
The range should be inclusive; if the user inputs 100 and 351 (or 351 and 100) these two
numbers (which are both non-prime) should be included in the output.
